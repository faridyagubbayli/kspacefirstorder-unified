## Overview

k-Wave is an open source toolbox originally written MATLAB designed for the time-domain simulation of propagating acoustic waves in 1D, 2D, or 3D. The toolbox has a wide range of functionality, but at its heart is an numerical model that can account for both linear or nonlinear wave propagation, an arbitrary distribution of heterogeneous material parameters, and power law acoustic absorption. See the [k-Wave website](http://www.k-wave.org) for further details.

This project builds on the great work of the original k-Wave authors: B. E. Treeby, J. Jaros, A. P. Rendell, and B. T. Cox, and the SC@FIT Research Group at Brno University of Technology who developed the original C++ implementations.

This project is a unified C++ implementation of the k-Wave toolbox that accelerates 2D/3D simulations using optimized implementations.
