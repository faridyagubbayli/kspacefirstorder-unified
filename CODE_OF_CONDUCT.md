# Our Pledge and Code of Conduct

We are a community of professionals and enthusiasts building great software together. We believe that a positive, respectful, and collaborative environment is the key to our success. This document is our shared pledge to create and maintain such an environment.

To ensure a productive and welcoming experience for everyone, we all agree to:

*   **Be Respectful:** We treat each other with courtesy and professionalism. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We value diverse perspectives and approach every discussion with an open mind.

*   **Assume Good Intent:** We begin by assuming that our colleagues are acting in good faith. We listen carefully and strive to understand each other's viewpoints before responding, which helps us avoid misunderstandings and build trust.

*   **Collaborate Constructively:** Our best work comes from building on each other's ideas. We give and receive feedback gracefully, focusing on the technical merits of the discussion. The goal is always to find the best solution for the project, together.

*   **Focus on the Work:** We are here to innovate and solve problems. By keeping our conversations professional and focused on the project, we ensure that our collective time is spent productively.

## Our Commitment

We are all stewards of this community. Upholding these standards is a shared responsibility. If you have any concerns or believe someone is not adhering to our pledge, please contact the project maintainers.
